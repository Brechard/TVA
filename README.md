# Multi-Agent Systems - Assignment in Strategic Voting

## Introduction
Strategic voting is common in political elections and there are various famous examples for this from different countries (see in References section). Moreover, because of the increasingly common usage of electronic voting and the risk of influencing the outcome through illegally manipulating the votersâ€™ preferences, the topic of strategic voting is receiving steadily growing attention since some years.

This software is the implementation of an agent called Tactical Voting Analyst (TVA) that analyzes for a given voting situation defined by a sef of true preferences and outputs the risk of strategic voting taking place.
